# MOH SSO Dashboard Backend

The backend is a Go/Gin modular monolith for the MOH Integrated Health Portal. It is feature-first and microservice-ready: feature modules own their HTTP handlers, routes, DTOs, mappers, services, and repositories where that ownership is clear, while shared infrastructure remains in cross-cutting packages.

## Runtime Responsibilities

- Keycloak authentication callback, session refresh, logout, and current-user profile.
- Dynamic system-aware RBAC synced from Keycloak clients, realm roles, client roles, users, and portal permission mappings.
- User, client/system, role, permission, and access administration.
- Announcements with persistent attachments, related links, email delivery, and public/news feed visibility.
- Email queue, attachment validation, retry, and delivery management.
- Notifications, unread state, delivery history, and delivery retry.
- Audit logging and audit exploration.
- Documents, templates, data quality, visualiser, surveillance, metrics, sessions, and storage location APIs.

## Architecture

```text
backend/
|-- cmd/
|   |-- server/                 # API server entrypoint
|   `-- cli/                    # Operational CLI tools
|-- config/                     # RBAC seed and backend configuration assets
|-- docs/
|   `-- openapi.yaml            # Machine-readable API contract starter
|-- internal/
|   |-- api/                    # Router shell and cross-cutting API handlers
|   |-- authz/                  # Permission constants, policies, and authz helpers
|   |-- bootstrap/              # Composition root
|   |-- db/                     # Migrations, sqlc queries, generated sqlc code
|   |-- email/                  # Email templates and attachment normalization
|   |-- features/               # Feature modules
|   |-- http/                   # Response envelopes and API errors
|   |-- keycloak/               # Keycloak admin/client integration
|   |-- middleware/             # Auth, audit, rate-limit, request middleware
|   |-- repository/             # Shared repository adapters
|   |-- service/                # Shared services
|   |-- storage/                # Local/NFS/S3 storage abstraction
|   |-- worker/                 # Background workers
|   `-- ws/                     # Websocket support
|-- app.env.example
|-- Dockerfile
`-- go.mod
```

Feature modules generally use this shape:

```text
internal/features/<feature>/
|-- handler.go
|-- routes.go
|-- dto.go
|-- mapper.go
|-- service.go
|-- repository.go
`-- repository_postgres.go or repository_keycloak.go
```

Not every module needs every file. Thin HTTP adapters such as `auth`, `metrics`, or `geojson` may stay smaller when the underlying service is shared.

## Architecture Boundary Checks

Backend feature-to-feature imports are guarded by an architecture test:

```bash
GOCACHE=/private/tmp/moh-sso-go-build go test ./internal/architecture
```

The same check runs inside `go test ./...`. Approved cross-feature imports are documented in [`../docs/backend-microservice-readiness.md`](../docs/backend-microservice-readiness.md). New feature dependencies should normally be expressed as constructor-injected interfaces or shared infrastructure packages, not direct imports.

## Composition Root

`internal/bootstrap` wires the application in one place:

- configuration
- database/sqlc store
- Keycloak clients
- Redis/rate limiter
- repositories
- services
- handlers
- workers
- router
- startup RBAC sync

Keep new construction logic in bootstrap. Feature code should receive dependencies through constructors, not create infrastructure directly.

## API Response Rules

Handlers should return feature-owned DTOs, not raw SQL rows or database models.

Success envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": {}
}
```

Error envelope:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "message": "Safe user-facing message"
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

Detailed database, Keycloak, or filesystem errors should be logged server-side and converted to safe API errors.

Every request receives a request ID and correlation ID. Clients may send `X-Request-ID` and `X-Correlation-ID`; otherwise the backend generates them. Responses expose both headers, and standard API envelopes include `meta.requestId`.

## RBAC And Keycloak

Keycloak is the identity source:

- users
- credentials
- realm roles
- clients
- client roles
- user role assignments

The portal DB stores authorization metadata:

- system/client display metadata
- launch URLs, icons, category, owner/support metadata
- permission catalog
- realm-role permission mappings
- system-role permission mappings
- access role metadata
- synced user access profiles and drift reports

Startup sync is controlled through `RBAC_STARTUP_*` env vars in `app.env.example`. The common local posture is:

```env
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_ENABLED=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SEED_ENABLED=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_LIVE_KEYCLOAK=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_USERS=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_PUSH_TO_KEYCLOAK=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_FAIL_ON_ERROR=false
```

See:

- [`../docs/rbac-keycloak-sync.md`](../docs/rbac-keycloak-sync.md)
- [`../docs/rbac-governance.md`](../docs/rbac-governance.md)
- [`../docs/system-onboarding.md`](../docs/system-onboarding.md)

## Announcements, Attachments, And Email

Announcements support:

- persistent attachment storage
- download URLs for news feed and email templates
- `include_in_email` flags per attachment
- optional related links through `link_url` and `link_label`
- publish/schedule flows that queue notification email deliveries

Email attachment payloads must provide exactly one of:

- `path`
- `data_base64`

Persistent announcement attachments are stored through the configured storage provider and can also be sent or linked during announcement email delivery.

## Notifications

Notifications support:

- list, read/unread state, counts, cleanup, and delete
- notification delivery records
- delivery status history
- manual retry for failed/retry/cancelled deliveries
- background email delivery worker

Delivery records are stored separately from notification records so operations can inspect channel-level failures without changing the notification message.

## Local Development

```bash
cd backend
cp app.env.example app.env
GOCACHE=/private/tmp/moh-sso-go-build go test ./...
go run ./cmd/server
```

## Versioning And Builds

Backend releases use component-scoped semantic tags such as `backend/v1.2.3`. The binary, Docker image labels, health response, `/version` endpoint, and deployment record all use the same linker-injected build metadata.

```bash
make build
./bin/moh-sso-dashboard --version

make build-cli
./bin/moh-sso version --output json

GOCACHE=/private/tmp/moh-sso-go-build make verify-version
```

Production deployments must set `BACKEND_TAG` to an immutable semantic or SHA image tag. They must not use `latest`.

See:

- [`../docs/versioning.md`](../docs/versioning.md)
- [`../docs/releasing-backend.md`](../docs/releasing-backend.md)
- [`../docs/deployment.md`](../docs/deployment.md)
- [`../docs/rollback.md`](../docs/rollback.md)

Docker Compose uses service hostnames such as:

- `backend-db`
- `redis`
- `keycloak`

Local direct execution usually needs localhost-facing overrides.

## Migrations

Migrations live under:

```text
internal/db/migrations
```

Do not edit generated sqlc files manually. Update SQL under `internal/db/query` and regenerate sqlc when query shape changes.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
cd backend
GOCACHE=/private/tmp/moh-sso-go-build go test ./...
```

Also run frontend verification when backend DTOs or API payloads change:

```bash
cd ../frontend
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use v20.20.1
./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 ./node_modules/.bin/eslint . --cache --cache-location .eslintcache --max-warnings=0
./node_modules/.bin/vite build --config vite.config.ts
```
