# MOH SSO Dashboard

MOH SSO Dashboard is the Integrated Health Portal for Ministry of Health Uganda. It provides a central authenticated portal for system launch, user and client administration, dynamic RBAC governance, announcements, email delivery, audit logs, document uploads, data quality workflows, surveillance dashboards, reports, and shared operational tooling.

The project is now organized as a feature-first backend and a monorepo-style microfrontend-ready frontend.

## Platform Overview

The portal has four major responsibilities:

1. Central sign-on through Keycloak.
2. System-aware authorization where Keycloak clients are represented as portal systems.
3. Modular product experiences delivered as frontend apps.
4. Backend APIs grouped by feature modules with clear ownership of handlers, routes, services, and repositories.

Core runtime components:

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend shell | Hosts layouts, routing, auth bootstrap, app launcher, import maps, and single-spa orchestration. |
| Frontend apps | Product modules such as users, clients, RBAC, surveillance, documents, audit, email, and data validation. |
| Frontend packages | Shared UI, API hooks, auth helpers, runtime config, state, types, utilities, and microfrontend contracts. |
| Go backend | Gin API server, feature modules, Keycloak integration, RBAC sync, notifications, email, audit, documents, and surveillance APIs. |
| Keycloak | Identity source of truth for users, credentials, realm roles, clients, and client roles. |
| PostgreSQL | Portal data, RBAC metadata, documents metadata, announcements, audit logs, notifications, email queue, and feature data. |
| Redis | Runtime cache/session/rate-limit support where configured. |

frontend/apps/<app>/src/root.component.tsx
frontend/apps/<app>/src/routes.tsx
frontend/apps/<app>/src/single-spa.tsx
frontend/apps/<app>/vite.config.ts
```

| Remote/orchestrated | `microfrontendMode: "remote"`, `microfrontendMountMode: "orchestrated"` | Production-style single-spa orchestration with import maps and independently staged bundles. |

Production config lives in `frontend/public/config.production.js`:

```js
window.__APP_CONFIG__ = {
  API_BASE_URL: "/api",
  microfrontendMode: "remote",
  singleSpaOrchestration: true,
  microfrontendMountMode: "orchestrated",
};
```

Development config lives in `frontend/public/config.development.js`:

```js
window.__APP_CONFIG__ = {
  API_BASE_URL: "http://localhost:9000",
  microfrontendMode: "local",
  singleSpaOrchestration: false,
  microfrontendMountMode: "hybrid",
};
```

Switch runtime config with:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run config:dev
npm run config:prod
npm run config:local-remote
```

## Backend Documentation

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a feature-first modular monolith structure. It is designed to stay deployable as one service now, while keeping boundaries clear enough for future service extraction.

```text
backend/internal/
|-- bootstrap/
|   |-- app.go
|   |-- infrastructure.go
|   |-- repositories.go
|   |-- services.go
|   |-- handlers.go
|   |-- workers.go
|   `-- server.go
|-- api/
|   |-- router.go
|   |-- handler/health_handler.go
|   `-- routes/
|-- authz/
|-- features/
|   |-- announcements/
|   |-- audit/
|   |-- clients/
|   |-- data_quality/
|   |-- document_templates/
|   |-- documents/
|   |-- email/
|   |-- rbac/
|   |-- sessions/
|   |-- storage_locations/
|   |-- surveillance/
|   |-- system_rbac/
|   `-- users/
|-- middleware/
|-- repository/
`-- service/
```

Feature modules generally use this shape:

```text
backend/internal/features/<feature>/
|-- handler.go
|-- routes.go
|-- dto.go
|-- mapper.go
|-- service.go
|-- repository.go
`-- repository_postgres.go or repository_keycloak.go
```

Not every feature has every file. Smaller HTTP adapters may only have handlers and routes. Cross-cutting services remain in `backend/internal/service`.

### Backend Composition

`backend/internal/bootstrap` is the composition root. It constructs:

- Config
- Database connections
- Keycloak client
- Redis/rate limiter
- Repositories
- Services
- Handlers
- Workers
- HTTP router
- Startup RBAC sync

`backend/internal/api/router.go` is the global HTTP shell. It mounts:

- Unauthenticated auth routes under `/api/v1/auth`
- Public announcement routes under `/api/v1/announcements`
- Protected routes under `/api/v1`
- Admin routes under `/api/v1/admin`
- Health routes outside the API prefix under `/health`, `/health/live`, and `/health/ready`

### Backend Feature Modules

| Feature | Backend folder | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin units | `features/admin_units` | Visualizer administrative unit lookup endpoints. |
| Announcements | `features/announcements` | Announcement lifecycle, targeting, email triggers, and persistent attachments. |
| Audit | `features/audit` | Audit log search, export, and audit metrics. |
| Auth | `features/auth` | Keycloak login, callback, session refresh, logout, and current user profile. |
| Clients | `features/clients` | Keycloak clients as portal systems and client roles. |
| Data quality | `features/data_quality` | Data quality issue and transaction APIs. |
| Document templates | `features/document_templates` | Template, sheet, column, publish, archive, and structure APIs. |
| Documents | `features/documents` | Document metadata, upload, view, download, process history, and reprocess. |
| Email | `features/email` | Email send, queue, retry, listing, and delete. |
| GeoJSON | `features/geojson` | GeoJSON assets for maps. |
| Metrics | `features/metrics` | Admin metrics for users, clients, logins, and security. |
| Notifications | `features/notifications` | Notifications, unread counts, read state, cleanup, and deletion. |
| RBAC | `features/rbac` | System-aware RBAC, Keycloak sync, drift, permissions, roles, and user access. |
| Sessions | `features/sessions` | Current user sessions and logout. |
| Storage locations | `features/storage_locations` | Storage configuration records. |
| Surveillance | `features/surveillance` | Epi weeks, alerts, diseases, locations, metrics, weekly statuses, and import batches. |
| Users | `features/users` | Keycloak user administration and user client role management. |
| Visualiser | `features/visualiser` | Dataset, data element, data value, theme, and HIV summary endpoints. |

## RBAC And Keycloak

Keycloak remains the identity source of truth:

- Users and credentials live in Keycloak.
- Realm roles live in Keycloak.
- Clients in Keycloak are systems in the portal RBAC model.
- Client roles in Keycloak are system roles in the portal RBAC model.
- Portal permissions live in the portal DB and are mapped to realm roles and system roles.

The portal DB stores RBAC metadata that Keycloak does not model directly:

- System display names, categories, icons, launch URLs, and visibility metadata.
- Permission catalog entries.
- Role-to-permission mappings.
- Realm-role-to-permission mappings.
- Access role metadata.
- Sync drift reports and audit events.
- User access profiles derived from Keycloak role assignments plus portal permission mappings.

### Startup RBAC Sync

Startup sync is configured through backend env vars:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_ENABLED` | Enables or disables startup sync. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SEED_ENABLED` | Applies the portal RBAC seed file. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SEED_PATH` | Path to seed file, usually `config/system-rbac.seed.yaml`. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_REALM_EXPORT` | Imports local realm-export metadata if available. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_REALM_EXPORT_PATH` | Optional explicit realm export path. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_LIVE_KEYCLOAK` | Pulls live Keycloak clients, roles, and users. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_USERS` | Syncs user access profiles from Keycloak. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_PUSH_TO_KEYCLOAK` | Creates missing roles back into Keycloak when intentionally enabled. |
| `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_FAIL_ON_ERROR` | Fails backend startup if RBAC sync fails. Useful in stricter environments. |

Recommended development settings:

```env
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_ENABLED=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SEED_ENABLED=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_LIVE_KEYCLOAK=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_USERS=true
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_PUSH_TO_KEYCLOAK=false
RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_FAIL_ON_ERROR=false
```

Recommended production posture:

- Keep Keycloak as the source for user role assignments.
- Keep portal DB as the source for permission metadata and launch metadata.
- Use RBAC drift tools before applying changes.
- Enable `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_FAIL_ON_ERROR=true` only when operational readiness requires sync failures to block startup.
- Keep `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_PUSH_TO_KEYCLOAK=false` unless intentionally promoting portal-defined roles into Keycloak.

## Configuration

### Backend Environment

Start from `backend/app.env.example`.

Required groups:

| Group | Key variables |
| --- | --- |
| Global | `ENVIRONMENT`, `GIN_MODE` |
| Frontend | `FRONTEND_BASE_URL`, `FRONTEND_REDIRECT_URI`, `API_BASE_URL`, `COOKIE_DOMAIN` |
| Keycloak | `KEYCLOAK_EXTERNAL_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL`, `KEYCLOAK_REALM`, `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID`, `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KEYCLOAK_WEB_CLIENT_ID`, `KEYCLOAK_WEB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `KEYCLOAK_REDIRECT_URI` |
| Backend | `SERVER_PORT`, `APP_BASE_URL` |
| RBAC sync | `RBAC_STARTUP_*` |
| Database | `DB_DRIVER`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_ENABLE_SSL` |
| Redis | `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` |
| JWT/session | `TOKEN_SYMMETRIC_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION` |
| Storage | `STORAGE_PROVIDER`, `LOCAL_BASE_PATH`, `NFS_BASE_PATH`, `S3_*`, `MINIO_*` |
| Visualiser/DWH | `DWH_HOST`, `DWH_PORT`, `DWH_USERNAME`, `DWH_PASSWORD`, `DWH_DB` |
| Email | `SMTP_*`, `EMAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENTS`, `EMAIL_ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_TYPES` |
| Announcements | `ANNOUNCEMENT_MAX_ATTACHMENTS`, `ANNOUNCEMENT_ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_TYPES` |
| Notifications | `PLATFORM_NAME`, `SYSTEM_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SYSTEM_ADMIN_NAME`, `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL` |

Important local cookie note:

```env
COOKIE_DOMAIN=
```

Do not use `COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost` for browser development. Browsers can reject or ignore cookies with `Domain=localhost`.

### Frontend Runtime Config

Runtime config is copied into `frontend/public/config.js`:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run config:dev
npm run config:prod
npm run config:local-remote
```

The frontend reads `window.__APP_CONFIG__` at runtime. This allows the same source to support local hybrid development and production import-map orchestration.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Go matching `backend/go.mod`
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node managed with nvm
- Node `v20.20.1` recommended for the frontend
- npm
- PostgreSQL/Redis/Keycloak through Docker, unless using external services

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use v20.20.1
npm install
npm run config:dev
npm run dev
```

The local shell is served under `/portal`.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp app.env.example app.env
GOCACHE=/private/tmp/moh-sso-go-build go test ./...
go run ./cmd/server
```

When running with Docker Compose, backend uses service hostnames such as `backend-db`, `redis`, and `keycloak`.

### Docker Development

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Use the development compose file when you want local containers for backend dependencies and development-friendly ports.

## Docker And Production Deployment

### Backend Image

`backend/Dockerfile` builds a static Go binary and runs it in Alpine:

```bash
docker build -t moh-sso-dashboard-backend ./backend
```

Production backend expects `app.env` or equivalent environment variables.

### Frontend Image

`frontend/Dockerfile` builds the production shell, packages, microfrontend bundles, version manifest, and staged assets.

```bash
docker build -t moh-sso-dashboard-frontend ./frontend
```

The production Docker build uses:

```text
FRONTEND_ASSET_BASE_URL=/portal
FRONTEND_BASE_PATH=/portal
```

and runs:

```bash
node scripts/use-runtime-config.mjs production
npm run build:docker
```

### Source-Based Frontend Deployment

Use this when building all apps and packages from local source:

```bash
cd frontend
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use v20.20.1
npm ci
npm run config:prod
npm run build:docker
```

### NPM-Package-Based Frontend Deployment

Use this when apps/packages have been published and deployment should stage app bundles from npm package artifacts:

```bash
cd frontend
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use v20.20.1
npm ci
npm run config:prod
npm run build:docker:npm-modules
```

### Production Compose

`docker-compose.yml` defines:

- `redis`
- `backend-db`
- `backend`
- `frontend`

The production compose expects app secrets in `./secrets/*` and environment in `./app.env`.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## API Reference

Base API prefix:

```text
/api/v1
```

Health routes are not under `/api/v1`.

### Response Envelope

Successful responses generally use:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": {}
}
```

Error responses generally use:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "message": "human readable message"
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

### Common API Payload Notes

Date/time strings should be sent as ISO-8601/RFC3339 strings unless a feature explicitly documents another format. IDs are UUID strings unless the route name says otherwise.

#### Client Create/Update Payload

Used by `POST /api/v1/clients` and `PUT /api/v1/clients/:id`.

```json
{
  "name": "Report Browser",
  "description": "Reports and dashboards",
  "icon": "reporting",
  "publicClient": false,
  "enabled": true,
  "rootUrl": "https://reports.example.org",
  "baseUrl": "/portal/apps/dwh/reports",
  "adminUrl": "",
  "redirectUris": ["https://reports.example.org/*"],
  "webOrigins": ["https://reports.example.org"],
  "attributes": {
    "category": "reporting"
  }
}
```

#### User Role Payloads

Add/remove roles for a user and client:

```json
{
  "clientId": "report-browser",
  "clientUuid": "optional-keycloak-client-uuid",
  "roles": ["report_browser_access", "report_admin"]
}
```

Set enabled state:

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

Dynamic RBAC user access is managed through `PUT /api/v1/admin/rbac/user-access/users/:userId`:

```json
{
  "realmRoles": ["admin"],
  "clientRoles": {
    "dashboard-web": ["dashboard-web_access"],
    "report-browser": ["report-browser_access", "report_admin"]
  },
  "permissions": ["portal:access", "report_browser:read"]
}
```

#### Announcement Payloads

Create announcement:

```json
{
  "title": "Surveillance update",
  "message": "Weekly outbreak bulletin is available.",
  "summary": "Weekly bulletin",
  "level": "information",
  "tag": "surveillance",
  "link_url": "/portal/apps/dwh/surveillance",
  "link_label": "Open surveillance dashboard",
  "priority": 5,
  "is_pinned": true,
  "status": "draft",
  "publish_at": "2026-06-16T09:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-07-16T09:00:00Z",
  "audience_type": "client",
  "client_ids": ["integrated-outbreak-system"],
  "role_names": ["integrated-outbreak-system_access"],
  "user_ids": [],
  "notify_by_email": true
}
```

Persistent announcement attachment upload:

```json
{
  "file_name": "weekly-bulletin.pdf",
  "content_type": "application/pdf",
  "data_base64": "base64-encoded-content",
  "include_in_email": true,
  "inline": false,
  "content_id": "",
  "sort_order": 1
}
```

Publish or schedule with transient email attachments:

```json
{
  "publish_at": "2026-06-16T09:00:00Z",
  "include_attachments_in_email": true,
  "attachments": [
    {
      "file_name": "bulletin.pdf",
      "content_type": "application/pdf",
      "data_base64": "base64-encoded-content",
      "inline": false
    }
  ]
}
```

For transient email attachments, provide exactly one of `path` or `data_base64`.
Persistent announcement attachments are stored as announcement assets and exposed
through `download_url`. When an announcement is published with email delivery,
attachments marked `include_in_email` are sent with the email and also rendered
as secure download links in the announcement email template. If `link_url` is set,
the template and News & Updates UI use `link_label` as the call-to-action text,
falling back to a generic label when it is omitted.

#### Email Payload

Used by `POST /api/v1/emails/send` and `POST /api/v1/emails/queue`.

```json
{
  "to": [
    {
      "name": "Health Worker",
      "email": "worker@example.org"
    }
  ],
  "cc": [],
  "bcc": [],
  "reply_to": [],
  "subject": "MOH bulletin",
  "text_body": "Plain text body",
  "html_body": "<p>HTML body</p>",
  "template_name": "",
  "template_data": {},
  "attachments": [
    {
      "file_name": "bulletin.pdf",
      "content_type": "application/pdf",
      "data_base64": "base64-encoded-content",
      "inline": false
    }
  ],
  "headers": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "scheduled_at": "2026-06-16T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Attachment payloads must provide exactly one of `path` or `data_base64`.

#### Document Payloads

`POST /api/v1/documents` accepts document upload data as implemented by the documents handler. `PUT /api/v1/documents/:id` updates metadata:

```json
{
  "original_filename": "report.xlsx",
  "content_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"
}
```

#### Data Quality Payloads

Create issue:

```json
{
  "dataset": "HMIS",
  "data_element": "Malaria cases",
  "org_unit": "Kampala",
  "issue": "Outlier detected",
  "issue_type": "outlier",
  "reported_by": "analyst@example.org",

{
  "clientId": "report-browser",
  "displayName": "Report Browser",
  "description": "Reports and dashboards",
  "icon": "reporting",
  "launchUrl": "/portal/apps/dwh/reports",
  "category": "reporting",
  "ownerTeam": "Analytics",
  "ownerName": "System Owner",
  "ownerEmail": "owner@example.org",

### Authentication And Authorization

Protected routes require a valid portal session established through Keycloak login.

Admin routes are mounted under:

```text
/api/v1/admin
```

Feature routes use permission middleware from `backend/internal/authz`. Examples:

| Permission | Typical use |
| --- | --- |
| `portal:access` | Basic authenticated portal/session access. |
| `users:read`, `users:write`, `users:roles:write` | User management. |
| `clients:read`, `clients:write`, `clients:roles:write` | Client/system management. |
| `rbac:read`, `rbac:write`, `rbac:roles:write`, `rbac:permissions:write` | RBAC governance. |
| `announcements:read`, `announcements:write`, `announcements:publish` | Announcement lifecycle. |

## Verification

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
GOCACHE=/private/tmp/moh-sso-go-build go test ./...
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use v20.20.1
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build:shell
```

Full frontend release check:

```bash
cd frontend
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm use v20.20.1
npm run release:check
```

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend blank page under `/portal`

Check runtime config:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run config:dev
```

For production Docker, make sure `config.js` contains:

```js
microfrontendMode: "remote";
singleSpaOrchestration: true;
microfrontendMountMode: "orchestrated";
```

Also make sure import map paths are rooted under `/portal`.

### Vite cannot resolve a microfrontend package

Check that the app package exists, has package exports, and is included in workspace aliases/import map generation.

Useful checks:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run mf:doctor
npm run audit:import-map
```

### RBAC sync starts but finds no realm export

Set `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_REALM_EXPORT_PATH` or place the realm export where the backend expects it. Live Keycloak sync can still run if `RBAC_STARTUP_SYNC_LIVE_KEYCLOAK=true`.

### Keycloak users have roles but cannot see apps

Confirm all of the following:

1. The Keycloak client exists.
2. The user has the correct client role.
3. The client role is registered as an access role in RBAC.
4. The system metadata has a valid `/portal/...` launch URL or absolute URL.
5. Startup sync or manual RBAC sync has run.
6. The frontend menu/app launcher gates the app using the expected permission or accessible system.

### Browser cookies not returned in local development

Use:

```env
COOKIE_DOMAIN=
```

Do not use `COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost`.

### Announcement update fails on enum values

Announcement enum values must match database enum values. Normalize UI values before sending update payloads.

### Email or announcement attachments are rejected

Validate:

- `EMAIL_ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_TYPES`
- `EMAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENTS`
- `EMAIL_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`
- `ANNOUNCEMENT_ALLOWED_ATTACHMENT_TYPES`
- `ANNOUNCEMENT_MAX_ATTACHMENTS`
- `ANNOUNCEMENT_MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES`

Email attachment payloads should provide exactly one of `path` or `data_base64`.

## Documentation Map

Each frontend app and package has its own README:

```text
frontend/apps/*/README.md
frontend/packages/*/README.md
```

Use this root README for system-level architecture, development, deployment, and API reference. Use module READMEs for module-specific UI behavior and ownership.
