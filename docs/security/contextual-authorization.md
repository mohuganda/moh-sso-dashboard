# Contextual Authorization

## Decision sequence

Every scoped operation must evaluate:

1. Authentication.
2. Functional permission.
3. Access to the owning portal system/client.
4. Direct and group-derived health-context assignments.
5. Assignment validity, node status, and scope mode.
6. Resource ownership or authorized query predicate.

Authenticated actors outside the resource scope receive `403`. Malformed
context identifiers receive `400`. Detailed database and hierarchy errors stay
in server logs.

## Least privilege

- Super-admin is not an implicit context bypass.
- Disabled nodes and expired assignments grant no access.
- Group-derived permission and group-derived context are evaluated and
  explained separately.
- Frontend visibility never substitutes for backend enforcement.
- Exports and downloads use the same predicates as list and detail endpoints.
- Aggregates must not reveal restricted lower-level data.

## Resource checks

Use middleware only to validate a selected context when that is sufficient.
For contextual route groups, the middleware fails closed when an assigned user
omits the context header. It allows a missing header only when the user has no
effective health-context assignments.
When ownership is known only after loading a resource, enforce access in the
feature service. Repositories should accept already-authorized context IDs and
include them in SQL predicates.

Emergency or delegated access is not enabled by default. A future implementation
must require a reason, approval, explicit expiry, audit events, and administrator
notification.

## Temporary and emergency access

The assignment model already supports `valid_from` and `valid_until`, so
time-bound access can be represented without adding a bypass. There is
currently no emergency override switch and no hidden super-admin exception.
Before enabling delegated or emergency workflows, add an approval record,
mandatory reason, approver separation, expiry enforcement, administrator
notification, and dedicated audit events. Expiry must be enforced by effective
context queries, not by a background cleanup job alone.

## Denial logging

Context middleware emits structured denial events with request ID, feature,
reason, and context type when known. Logs do not include patient data, resource
payloads, user contact details, or context-specific metric labels.
