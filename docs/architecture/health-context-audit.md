# Health Context Audit

## Existing hierarchy models

The platform already has several location representations. They serve different
purposes and must not be collapsed without a migration plan.

| Source | Purpose | Current identifiers | Health-context relationship |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `admin_units` | Reads the DWH organisation-unit hierarchy | DHIS2-style UIDs and names | Map with aliases such as `dhis2` or `dwh-org-unit` |
| Surveillance | Operational regions, districts, sub-counties, and facilities | Portal UUIDs and codes | Map each scoped record with `surveillance-*` aliases |
| GeoJSON | Boundary geometry delivery | Static boundary metadata | Reference context aliases; do not store geometry in health context |
| Visualiser | Reads `hiv.organisation_unit` | Organisation-unit UIDs | Constrain requested UIDs using aliases before querying |
| RBAC groups | Identity membership and role/permission inheritance | Portal group UUID, Keycloak ID, path | Explicitly map groups to context nodes |

The canonical authorization hierarchy is `health_context_nodes` and
`health_context_closure`. Domain features retain their own operational fields.
`health_context_aliases` connects an authorization node to a domain or external
identifier without relying on display names.

## Current risk inventory

Before health-context integration, the following query surfaces accept location
filters without a common contextual-authorization boundary:

- Surveillance alerts, weekly status, dashboards, imports, and facility metrics.
- Visualiser organisation-unit selections and report drill-downs.
- Admin-unit hierarchy and GeoJSON boundary endpoints.
- Data-quality runs and issues.
- Issue-tracker records.

These endpoints continue to use their existing authorization until each owning
feature adopts the integration contract. The presence of
`X-Health-Context-ID` or the frontend selector alone does not make an endpoint
context-safe.

## Integration decision

1. Keep clinical, reporting, and geometry attributes in their owning features.
2. Store generic hierarchy, assignments, active selection, and scope mode in
   `health_context`.
3. Map existing records by stable namespace and external ID.
4. Resolve aliases and authorize them server-side before applying query filters.
5. Add resource ownership and query predicates feature by feature.

## Rollout status

| Capability | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Hierarchy, closure table, aliases | Implemented |
| Direct and group assignments | Implemented |
| Active context and `/auth/me` summary | Implemented |
| Permission plus system access plus context policy | Implemented as reusable boundary |
| Shell selector and microfrontend propagation | Implemented |
| Surveillance row and aggregate enforcement | Pending feature migration |
| Report/visualiser enforcement | Pending feature migration |
| Document ownership, mutations, downloads, previews, and statistics | Implemented; legacy records are initially classified at the Uganda root |
