# API Reference

This document is the human-readable API map for the MOH Integrated Health Portal backend.

Machine-readable OpenAPI starter:

```text
backend/docs/openapi.yaml
```

Base API prefix:

```text
/api/v1
```

Health endpoints are outside `/api/v1`.

## Response Envelope

Successful responses:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "meta": {}
}
```

Error responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "message": "Safe user-facing message"
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

Handlers should return feature DTOs and safe error messages. They should not expose raw SQL rows, sqlc models, filesystem paths, stack traces, or raw database errors.

## Auth

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/login` | Public, rate limited | Start Keycloak login. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/callback` | Public, rate limited | Handle Keycloak authorization callback. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/me` | Session | Return current user, realm roles, client roles, permissions, and accessible systems. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/auth/refresh` | Session, rate limited | Refresh portal session. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/auth/logout` | Session | Log out current browser session. |

`auth/me` is the primary frontend bootstrap endpoint. It is the source for menu visibility, app launcher visibility, permissions, and accessible systems.

## Users

Protected user routes:

| Method | Path | Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users` | `users:read` | List users. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users/:id` | `users:read` | Get user. |

Admin user routes:

| Method | Path | Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users` | `users:read` | List users. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id` | `users:read` | Get user. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users` | `users:write` | Create Keycloak user. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id` | `users:write` | Update user profile. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id` | `users:write` | Delete user. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/enabled` | `users:write` | Enable or disable user. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/toggle` | `users:write` | Toggle enabled state. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/onboarding-email` | `users:write` | Send onboarding email. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/verification-email` | `users:write` | Send verification email. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/password-reset` | `users:write` | Send password reset email. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/reset-password` | `users:write` | Reset password. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/client-roles` | `users:read` | List user roles grouped by client. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/clients/:clientID/roles` | `users:read` | List one user's roles for one client. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/clients/:clientID/roles` | `users:roles:write` | Add client roles to user. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/clients/:clientID/roles` | `users:roles:write` | Remove client roles from user. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/admin/users/:id/client-roles` | `users:roles:write` | Replace/update user client role assignments. |

Preferred dynamic access management is through RBAC user-access endpoints, because they validate Keycloak realm roles, client roles, and portal permission mappings together.

## Clients And Systems

Clients are Keycloak clients represented as portal systems.

| Method | Path | Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clients` | `systems:read` or `clients:read` | List clients/systems. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clients/:id` | `clients:read` | Get client/system. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/clients` | `clients:write` | Create client/system. |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/clients/:id` | `clients:write` | Update client/system. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/clients/:id/toggle` | `clients:write` | Enable or disable client. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/clients/:id` | `clients:write` | Delete client. |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/clients/:id/roles` | `clients:read` | List client roles. |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/admin/clients/:id/roles` | `clients:roles:write` | Create client role. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/admin/clients/:id/roles/:role` | `clients:roles:write` | Delete client role. |

When a system is added to Keycloak, RBAC sync should import it into the portal registry. Users need the relevant client role, such as `<clientId>_access`, before the app appears in menus/launcher.
