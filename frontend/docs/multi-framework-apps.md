# Multi-Framework Apps

Future frontend apps may use React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or plain JavaScript.

Every app must expose the same lifecycle contract:

```ts
export async function bootstrap(props) {}
export async function mount(props) {}
export async function unmount(props) {}
```

Each app should accept `MicrofrontendRuntimeProps` from `@moh-sso/microfrontend`.

## Recommended Adapters

- React: `single-spa-react`
- Vue: `single-spa-vue`
- Angular: `single-spa-angular`
- Svelte: `single-spa-svelte`
- Plain JavaScript: direct lifecycle **exports**

## Rules

- Apps must not import shell internals.
- Apps should communicate through shared **packages**, route props, or events.
- Cross-app dependencies should be intentional and documented.
- Shared UI, API, auth, config, state, and types should live in `frontend/packages`.
