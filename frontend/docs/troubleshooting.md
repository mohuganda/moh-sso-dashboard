# Troubleshooting

## Vite Warns About Node Version

Vite 7 expects Node `20.19+` or `22.12+`.

Fix:

```bash
node --version
```

Switch to Node 20.19+ or 22.12+.

## Failed To Resolve `single-spa-react`

Fix:

```bash
npm install
```

The React lifecycle helper has a manual fallback, but the package should still be installed for normal single-spa React behavior.

## `npm ci` Fails

Cause: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are out of sync.

Fix:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Commit the updated lockfile.

## Docker Build Fails At `npm ci`

Same cause as local `npm ci` failure.

Fix:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Commit `package-lock.json`, then rerun Docker.

## App Build Fails Due Missing Dependency

Run:

```bash
npm run audit:packages
```

Add the missing dependency or peer dependency to the app/package manifest.

## Remote Mode Loads A Blank App

Check:

- import map URL
- app `single-spa.js` is served
- app `basename`
- browser console
- network tab for failed module requests

## Duplicate React Or Invalid Hook Call

Likely cause: remote bundles are loading more than one React instance.

Fix:

- keep React as a peer dependency
- share React through the import map
- avoid bundling duplicate React into remote apps

## Route Works In Shell But Fails In Remote App

Check:

- app root `basename`
- nested app routes
- shell route path
- `MicrofrontendRuntimeProps.basename`

## Docker Dev Only Starts Shell

Default Docker dev runs shell-only mode.

Use:

```bash
FRONTEND_DEV_COMMAND="npm run dev:remote:all" docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up frontend
```

## Import Map Points To Missing Vendor Files

The current production import map uses pinned CDN ESM URLs. If using self-hosted vendor files, make sure those files exist and are served.
