# MOH SSO Dashboard Frontend

This frontend is a workspace-based React/Vite application prepared for single-spa microfrontends. The default development and deployment path still works as one shell application, while standalone apps can also build independently and be staged under `dist/mf`.

The application launcher and user side navigation are registry-driven. Platform systems use internal routing and may contribute permission-filtered navigation. External systems are launcher-only and use either new-tab or same-tab navigation. If no authorized navigation remains, the shell removes the side navigation and its reserved width.

- `apps/shell` owns layouts, route composition, auth guards, providers, and microfrontend orchestration.
- `apps/<app>` own product pages, feature components, nested app routes, and single-spa lifecycle entrypoints.
- `packages/<package>` own shared API hooks, auth/state contracts, UI, config, types, utilities, and microfrontend contracts.

More detail: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Prerequisites

Use Node `20.19+` or `22.12+` for Vite 7. Node 18 may still build in some environments, but Vite will warn.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Development

Shell-only mode:

```bash
npm run dev:shell
```

Shell plus selected remote microfrontend dev servers:

```bash
npm run dev:remote:users
npm run dev:remote:clients
npm run dev:remote:documents
```

Shell plus all remote microfrontend dev servers:

```bash
npm run dev:remote:all
```

Local ports:

- shell: `3000`
- users: `4101`
- clients: `4102`
- announcements: `4103`
- audit: `4104`
- email: `4105`
- documents: `4106`
- surveillance: `4107`
- data-visualizer: `4108`
- issue-tracker: `4109`
- report-browser: `4110`
- e-services: `4111`
- utilities: `4112`
- rbac: `4113`
- data-validation: `4114`

## Common Commands

```bash
npm run audit:packages
npm run audit:inline-styles
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build:shell
npm run build:packages
npm run build:apps
npm run build:all
npm run generate:versions
npm run build:docker
```

`npm run audit:packages` verifies that every app/package declares the packages it imports. Run it after changing imports or package manifests.

## Styling

Use SCSS for project-owned styles in apps and packages. Keep styles feature-local unless they are truly reusable, then move them into `packages/ui`. Vendor CSS imports such as Carbon, Leaflet, and pivot table styles are allowed to stay as `.css` imports.

Avoid inline styles for static layout, spacing, color, and typography. Prefer MOH theme classes, Carbon components, and SCSS modules/files. Inline styles should be limited to runtime-computed values that cannot be represented safely as classes, such as chart dimensions or map coordinates. Run `npm run audit:inline-styles` to review remaining inline style usage.

## Versioning And Releases

Shared packages release together as a fixed release train, while apps version independently as deployable units. Changesets records public changes and controls version bumps. Remote deployments can pin app/package versions through the import map.

More detail: [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## Docker

From the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile.nginx frontend
docker build -f frontend/Dockerfile.dev frontend
```

Docker dev defaults to shell-only mode. To run all remote dev servers in Docker:

```bash
FRONTEND_DEV_COMMAND="npm run dev:remote:all" docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up frontend
```

## Deployment

`npm run build:docker` builds packages, generates the import map, builds apps, builds the shell, and stages microfrontend bundles into `dist`.

Final static layout:

```text
dist/index.html
dist/assets/*
dist/import-map.json
dist/mf/<app>/single-spa.js
dist/packages/<package>/index.js
```

## Troubleshooting

- Vite Node warning: use Node `20.19+` or `22.12+`.
- Missing dependency or app build failure: run `npm run audit:packages`.
- `npm ci` fails in Docker: run `npm install` locally and commit the updated `package-lock.json`.
- Remote app loads blank: check the import map URL, served `single-spa.js`, basename, and browser console.
